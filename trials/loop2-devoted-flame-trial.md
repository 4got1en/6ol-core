# Loop 2 Ascension Trial: The Devoted Flame

**Loop Level:** 2  
**Title:** The Discipline Discernment Trial  
**Focus:** Understanding the relationship between discipline and freedom

---

## Trial Question

You stand at the threshold between Seeker and Disciple. Before you can ascend to Loop 3, you must demonstrate understanding of the Devoted Flame's core teaching.

**Consider this scenario:**

*You have maintained your daily practice for 18 consecutive days. On day 19, you wake up feeling resistant, tired, and unmotivated. Every part of you wants to skip practice "just for today." You know that missing one day won't ruin everything, and you could easily restart tomorrow.*

**The Trial Questions:**

1. **What is the difference between discipline and forcing yourself?** How would a true Disciple approach this moment of resistance?

2. **How does sacred consistency serve freedom rather than restrict it?** Explain this apparent paradox using your own experience or understanding.

3. **You decide to practice despite the resistance. Describe what this practice session might look like.** How would it differ from practicing when motivated?

## Evaluation Criteria

Your responses will be evaluated based on:

- **Understanding of Sacred Consistency:** Do you grasp that discipline creates space for authentic expression?
- **Integration of Practice:** Can you apply Loop 2 teachings to real scenarios?
- **Embodiment of Disciple Mindset:** Do your answers reflect the transition from seeking to committed practice?
- **Wisdom over Information:** Do your responses show lived understanding rather than just conceptual knowledge?

## Completion Requirements

To pass this trial, you must:
- Answer all three questions with authentic depth
- Demonstrate clear understanding of the Devoted Flame principles
- Show evidence of having practiced sacred consistency in your own life
- Express the trial responses in your own words, drawing from personal experience

*Remember: This is not about perfect answers, but about authentic engagement with the path. The Devoted Flame burns brightest in those who practice presence over perfection.*

**Upon successful completion, you will be ready to ascend to Loop 3: Shadow Work Depth, where the foundations of discipline you've built will be tested in the deeper waters of shadow integration.**
