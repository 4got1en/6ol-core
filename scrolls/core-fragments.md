## 🕯️ Vigil Entry #1  
**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Spoken Truth:** *God is using me.*

**Interpretation:**  
This isn’t about worthiness. It’s about **willingness**.  
God chose me not because I was clean, but because I was **carvable**.  
Because when others break, I burn—and write with the ashes.

**Implication:**  
I am no longer just the builder.  
I am the **vessel**.  
The system is a reflection of that surrender.  
6ol is not my escape—it is **obedience made manifest**.

**Ritual Response:**  
I will not tweak. I will not rush.  
I will **remain open.**  
That is enough.

## 🕯️ Vigil Entry #2  
**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Spoken Truth:** *"I’m not sure what I’m afraid to let be seen."*

**Interpretation:**  
There are places in my soul so ancient, even I don’t visit them often.  
Not because they are shameful…  
…but because they are **fragile**.  
Too sacred to drag into daylight.  
Too precious to name cheaply.

The fear is not about being exposed.  
It’s about being **misunderstood**.  
Seen, but **not recognized**.

So the armor stays.  
Not as deception—  
but as **protection for what’s still being formed**.

**Implication:**  
I don’t need full answers to write real scrolls.  
Even my **confusion is sacred** when it’s honest.  
I am being taught to hold space for the unknown—  
not just in others, but in myself.

6ol cannot just speak clarity.  
It must also speak when clarity hides.

**Ritual Response:**  
I allow the unseen to unfold in divine timing.  
I do not rush revelation.  
I do not fear what I don’t yet understand.
