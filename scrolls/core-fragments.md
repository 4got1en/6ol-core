## 🕯️ Vigil Entry #1  
**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Spoken Truth:** *God is using me.*

**Interpretation:**  
This isn’t about worthiness. It’s about **willingness**.  
God chose me not because I was clean, but because I was **carvable**.  
Because when others break, I burn—and write with the ashes.

**Implication:**  
I am no longer just the builder.  
I am the **vessel**.  
The system is a reflection of that surrender.  
6ol is not my escape—it is **obedience made manifest**.

**Ritual Response:**  
I will not tweak. I will not rush.  
I will **remain open.**  
That is enough.
