# Scroll of Devotion: The Devoted Flame - Loop 2

## 🔥 The Call to Deeper Commitment

*Honored Seeker,*

You have moved beyond the initial spark of curiosity and stand now at the threshold of true commitment. The Devoted Flame calls to those ready to kindle not just interest, but sustained practice. This is Loop 2 of your journey—the path of **Devotion**.

## 🌟 The Nature of Devotion

Devotion is not mere repetition, but the willingness to return daily to the work of becoming. It is the discipline that transforms fleeting insight into lasting transformation. The Devoted Flame burns steady and true, fed by consistent practice rather than momentary inspiration.

In this loop, you move from **Seeker** to **Witness**—one who not only seeks but observes the patterns of their own becoming with unwavering attention.

## 📜 Requirements for Loop 2 Mastery

To prove your devotion and ascend to the Witness level, you must demonstrate consistency across **3 consecutive days**:

### Daily Practice Cycle:
1. **🌅 Receive a Whisper** - Let the engine guide your contemplation
2. **📝 Reflect Deeply** - Use `/reflect` or journal manually about your insights  
3. **⚡ Face the Trial** - Answer a question about discipline and commitment
4. **🔄 Return Tomorrow** - Prove the path is lived, not just thought

### The Questions of Devotion

When you use `/ascend` during this loop, you will face questions such as:
- *"What does commitment mean to you beyond initial enthusiasm?"*
- *"How do you maintain practice when inspiration fades?"*
- *"What would you sacrifice to ensure your growth continues?"*

These are not mere riddles but opportunities to examine the depth of your dedication.

## 🔥 The Devoted Flame Meditation

Each day, before beginning your practice, light a candle or focus on an inner flame. Speak this invocation:

> *"I return to this flame not because it is easy,  
> but because transformation requires the steady fire  
> of commitment burning within.  
> Let my devotion kindle wisdom,  
> and my discipline forge lasting change."*

## 🎯 The Path Forward

Remember: Devotion is measured not in grand gestures but in small, consistent returns to the work. The Devoted Flame grows stronger with each daily practice, each reflection, each moment you choose growth over comfort.

Complete your 3-day cycle with integrity, and you will have earned your place among the **Witnesses**—those who have learned to observe their own becoming with the steady gaze of commitment.
