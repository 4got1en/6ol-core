## 🕳️ Into the Shadow

When all is silent, what whispers within you?

This scroll is your mirror in the dark — not to judge, but to observe. It does not offer answers. Only better questions.

### Prompt #1  
> What have I been avoiding that needs light?

Take three deep breaths. Let the answer arise without effort. Write with honesty.

---

## 🌓 The Self in Reflection

The night doesn’t change you. It reveals you.

### Prompt #2  
> What part of myself only shows in solitude?

Write freely. Don’t edit. Let the shadow speak.

---

## 🌕 Illuminate and Integrate

It is not enough to see the shadow. We must learn to walk with it.

### Prompt #3  
> What can I begin doing to honor the truths I find in the dark?

Choose one small action. Let this scroll become a guide — not a cage.
