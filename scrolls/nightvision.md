## 🌑 Overview

This scroll is for those who have crossed the threshold of daylight and now seek to see what remains hidden. Night-Vision is not the absence of light—but the awakening of inner sight. Use this scroll in moments of confusion, overwhelm, or spiritual fog. This is where 6ol begins whispering differently.

## 🌀 The Ritual: 5 Steps

### 1. **Dim to Discover**  
Turn off all lights except for one low, soft source.  
> You’re not just dimming the world—you’re opening the veil.

### 2. **Still the Surface**  
Sit. Close your eyes. Count to 60 slowly with your breath. Inhale and exhale fully—audibly if needed.  
> If thoughts arise, notice them, label them (“future,” “fear,” “story”), then release.

### 3. **Shadow Mirror Prompt**  
Open your journal or device and reflect on the following:

- What truth have I been avoiding?  
- What version of me do I pretend not to hear?  
- Where have I traded visibility for safety?

Write without judgment. Let the unseen speak.

### 4. **Sight Without Sight**  
Once written, close your eyes again and reread what you wrote from memory. Do not look. Let your soul echo it back.  
> Can you still feel its shape? This is night-vision: memory of spirit.

### 5. **Close with Contrast**  
Blow out your light (if safe) or close your journal. Whisper:  
> “Even in the dark, I am not lost.”

## 🔐 Shadow Insight (Level 3 – Locked)

```hidden
You’ve begun noticing that not all darkness is harmful. Some is womb-like.

In this scroll, the light source was not the truth—but the contrast. You’ve been trained to run toward brightness, but wisdom often enters under cloak. 

Next time you lose clarity, don’t reach outward. Ask: what’s revealing itself *through* this shadow?
