### 1. Why “Night-Vision”?

When the world sleeps, our inner mind stirs. “Night-Vision Insight” teaches you to record subtle energies—dream fragments, emotional triggers, or creative sparks that surface at dusk.

> **Reflection Prompt:**  
> Last night, what dream or thought lingered in your mind? Write it down in your journal.

### 2. Level 2 Reflective Exercise

1. Pick a quiet moment tonight (after dinner, before bed).  
2. Close your eyes and remember any detail—conversation, dream, or moment that felt significant.  
3. Open your journal and describe it in as much detail as possible (minimum 150 words).  
4. Identify one lesson or pattern: “What did this reveal about my current path?”

> **Tip:** Use localStorage (in your browser’s Console) to test:  
> ```js
> localStorage.setItem('6ol_test', 'nightvision');
> console.log(localStorage.getItem('6ol_test'));
> ```

### 3. Preparing for “Shadow Work Depth” (Level 3)

- Compile a list of recurring thoughts or fears that arise in your nighttime reflections.  
- Keep track of any synchronicities or signs that repeat (e.g., a symbol in your dreams).  
- When you feel ready, unlock `umbra` for Level 3. That Scroll will push you further.
