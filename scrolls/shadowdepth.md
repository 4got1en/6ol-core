### 1. What is “Shadow Work”?

Shadow Work is the practice of bringing unconscious fears, judgments, and disowned parts of yourself into light. It’s a conscious, structured way to reclaim energy that’s been stuck in negative cycles.

> **Reflection Prompt:**  
> Identify one fear or shame you’ve never shared. Write it without censoring. Then write a compassionate letter to that part of you.

### 2. Level 3 Shadow Exercise

1. Set aside 30 minutes in a quiet space.  
2. Focus on your breath for 3 minutes to center yourself.  
3. Recall a moment when you felt judged or limited (early childhood is ideal).  
4. Write down that memory in detail.  
5. Ask: “What belief formed from that moment?” Write it out.  
6. Turn that belief into its opposite: e.g., “I am unworthy” → “I am inherently worthy.”  
7. Speak the opposite aloud three times in front of a mirror (or hold your phone camera).

> **Tip:** Back up your entry by copying it into your black journal or digital notes. This can be intense; honor yourself afterward—take a walk, meditate, or do whatever grounds you.

- Allow 24 hours for emotions to settle.  
- Revisit “Night-Vision Insight” to see if any new patterns emerged.  
- If you’re feeling stuck, consider sharing a summary with a trusted friend or mentor.  
- Once you’ve integrated this practice, you can repeat at any interval (monthly, quarterly).
