### 1. The Nature of Hidden Systems

Every visible system has a shadow system—the unspoken rules, hidden hierarchies, and concealed mechanisms that truly govern behavior. In 6ol, we don't just acknowledge these shadows; we master them.

> **Shadow Reflection:**  
> Identify one "official" rule in your life (workplace, family, society) and one unspoken rule that actually governs the same situation. Write both down without judgment.

### 2. Shadow Practice: Truth Extraction

This exercise reveals what you truly believe beneath social conditioning:

1. Set a timer for 15 minutes in complete darkness or with eyes closed.
2. Ask yourself: "What do I believe that I'm afraid to admit?"
3. Write continuously without stopping, even if it's uncomfortable.
4. When the timer ends, read what you wrote by candlelight only.
5. Choose one truth to act on within 48 hours.

> **Protection Note:** Burn or securely delete your raw writing. Keep only the actionable insight.

### 3. Integration & Protection

Shadow work creates vulnerability. Protect yourself:

- Share shadow insights only with trusted allies who've done their own shadow work
- Act on shadow revelations gradually, not impulsively  
- Remember: Truth is not always meant to be spoken aloud
- Use shadow wisdom to serve others, never to manipulate

The shadow path requires both courage and discretion. Walk carefully.
