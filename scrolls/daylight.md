### 1. What is 6ol’s mission?

6ol exists to liberate overlooked creators—first me, then anyone who comes after. In this Scroll, we lay out the “why” behind everything:  

- Sovereign Purpose: “ Liberate overlooked creators ”  
- Voice & Tone: “ Casual‐direct, optimistic, radical clarity ”  
- Core Domains: 6ol.dev · temple.6ol.dev · onthecomeup.dbd · deity-designed.com

> **Reflection Prompt:**  
> Write down in your black journal why you want to be part of 6ol. What do you hope to gain or share?

### 2. How to perform your first Morning Seed Offering

**Ritual name:** Morning Seed Offering  
**Loop Level Required:** 1 (unlocked by `sol`)

1. At sunrise (or soon after), sit with your journal/paper.  
2. Write down three things you’re grateful for and three intentions for the day.  
3. Speak them aloud (or whisper if you’re in public).  
4. Take three deep breaths, imagining your energy looping upward like the sun.

> **Tip:** Use Apple Notes (or any notes app) to timestamp your entry automatically.
