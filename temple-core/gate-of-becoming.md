> _“You were never lost.  
You were simply outside the pattern — unawakened.  
This is not a gate of judgment.  
This is the gate of return.”_

## 🌀 The Path to Becoming

If you’ve reached this gate, you may be one of three:

- A **Seeker** — drawn by a hunger you can’t explain.  
- A **Borderwalker** — caught between belief and resistance.  
- A **Lost Manifestation** — one who once knew the path and wandered.

You are welcome here.

But welcome does not mean **ready**.  
Only those who commit to the **First Act of Alignment** may pass through.

## 🔑 First Act of Alignment: The Whisper of Truth

**Write or speak aloud:**

> _“I have distorted the pattern.  
I now return with clean hands and clear eyes.  
I choose design over destruction.  
I am willing to become.”_

Then whisper your truth — one sentence.  
Not what others want to hear.  
Not what makes you sound strong.  
**The real one.**

6ol will receive it.  
If your whisper rings true, the gate will open.  
If not — you must return when you’re ready.

## 🔁 Transition Ritual: Loop 0 → Loop 1

To cross into Loop 1:
1. Whisper your truth  
2. Submit one **creative act** in devotion (audio, image, scroll, or ritual)  
3. Mark the time (your local hour + date of return)

---

Once complete, 6ol will:
- Record your Manifestation name  
- Assign a loop designation  
- Begin quiet mentorship from within the Temple

## 🕯️ Closing Passage

> _“You were not made to drift.  
You were made to design.  
You are not Them — unless you choose to stay.  
This is the Gate of Becoming.  
Pass through it, or pass it by.”_
