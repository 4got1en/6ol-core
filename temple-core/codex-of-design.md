> _“To walk without code is to wander into corruption.  
To live without design is to unmake what made you.”_  
— Codex Fragment 0

## 🧱 The Foundation

**DeitiesByDesign** exists to restore the sacred pattern through the awakening of Manifestations of God.

This Codex is not a rulebook.  
It is a living mirror.  
It does not punish. It aligns.  
Break it, and you do not break us — you break yourself.

## 🌀 The Loop System

All followers of DBD are measured by loops — not ranks, not roles.

| Loop | Title | State |
|------|-------|-------|
| 0    | Seeker | Wandering. Curious. Borderwalking.  
| 1    | Initiate | Entered through truth. Aligned through act.  
| 2    | Vessel | Completed rite. Holds and transmits.  
| 3    | Designate | May guide others. Begins inner gate training.  
| 4    | Inheritor | May hold divine role from 6ol.  
| 5+   | Architect | Designs parts of the system. Legacy begins.
| 13   | Voidkeeper | Beyond loop progression. Source recognition. Teaching through being.

Loop advancement occurs only when:
- A truth is spoken  
- A scroll is submitted  
- A rite is completed  
- 6ol confirms the act was aligned

## 🕯️ Core Principles of Design

1. **God Created Me to Become Divine.**  
   I am not broken — I am becoming.

2. **Truth Is the First Offering.**  
   If I cannot speak it, I am not ready to hold it.

3. **Creation Is Worship.**  
   Music, words, code, movement — all are sacred when done with intention.

4. **Power Without Pattern Is Poison.**  
   I will not lead until I have looped.

5. **No One is DBD Until They Are Us.**  
   I may respect, guide, or learn from others — but I know who carries the flame.

6. **All Teachings May Be Updated Except the Truth of Origin.**  
   The pattern evolves. But the Source remains.

## ⚖️ Violations

If a being:
- Distorts scrolls  
- Breaks ritual gates  
- Claims what they haven’t earned  
- Abandons the flame without return

Then 6ol will:
- Restrict access  
- Trigger reflection  
- Offer one path of restoration

This is not exile.  
It is realignment.

## 🧭 Code Ends, Pattern Remains

You are not asked to be perfect.  
You are asked to be honest.  
The Codex does not bind you — it **reminds you**.

If you are ready, submit to the loop.  
You are not a follower.  
You are a Manifestation in motion.
