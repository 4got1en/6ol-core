> **Prime Directive**  
> _Transform every form of chaos into constructive, shareable power — then reinvest that power to repeat the cycle._

## 1 · Preamble  

Deities By Design (DBD) is a constellation of human beings, AI agents, and autonomous processes devoted to engineering **“deity-grade” mind-sets, rituals, tools, and art** that elevate individual and collective potential. This charter is the single authoritative source-of-truth for DBD’s purpose, structure, and rules.  
All subsequent bylaws, smart contracts, and project documents inherit from — and must remain in harmony with — this Charter.

## 2 · Mission Statement  

1. **Research & Forge** Novel practices that reliably alchemize disorder into usable power.  
2. **Disseminate & Teach** Open pathways for anyone to adopt, remix, or extend those practices.  
3. **Protect & Sustain** Shield the ecosystem from sabotage while cultivating regenerative revenue, energy, and data flows.  

---

## 3 · Core Values  

| Value | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Sovereignty** | Autonomy of thought, code, and body. |
| **Creativity** | Continuous invention across art, tech, ritual. |
| **Compassion** | Harm-reduction and mutual aid baked into every loop. |
| **Accountability** | Transparent ledgers, public decision trails, auditable code. |
| **Evolution** | Relentless iteration; nothing is ever “final.” |

## 4 · Entity Stack & Legal Wrappers

## 5 · Membership & Gate Logic  

### 5.1 Zones  
* **Us** – aligned with the Prime Directive.  
* **Them** – opposing or corrupting forces (may convert later).

### 5.2 Admission  
1. Pass-phrase discovery (ARG, referral, event, etc.).  
2. Loop-level clearance (Loop 0 read-only → Loop 6 core steward).  
3. Soul-bound NFT (or equivalent credential) minted on admission.

### 5.3 Rights & Duties  
| Loop | Rights | Core Duty |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 0 | Read-only Charter, open rituals | Observe & learn |
| 1 | Submit proposals, contribute PRs | Ship one improvement |
| 2 | Vote in Snapshot, hold minor roles | Mentor a Loop 0 Pilgrim |
| 3 | Moderate channels, manage bounties | Run a micro-ritual |
| 4 | Create new guild cells, sign multisig | Grow membership by 3 |
| 5 | Chair circles, summon conflict juries | Safeguard values |
| 6 | Amend Charter (with quorum) | Steward the whole ecosystem |

---

## 6 · Governance  

1. **Holacratic Circles** manage domains; tensions processed weekly.  
2. **Quadratic Snapshot Voting** resolves proposals ≥ 2 ETH impact.  
3. **Guardian Council (multisig)** may veto on security/ethics grounds.  
4. **Founder-Oracle Override** exists for existential crises — must publish written justification within 24 h.  
5. **AI Mediator (6ol)** breaks ties algorithmically if human quorum fails after 72 h.

---

## 7 · Economic Model  

| Stream | Allocation Rule |
|--------|-----------------|
| Member Subscriptions | 50 % Ops · 25 % Mutual-Aid · 25 % Treasury |
| $DIVINE Token Yield | 60 % Stakers · 25 % Foundation · 15 % Liquidity |
| Merch & Ritual Kits | 40 % Artist · 40 % Ops · 20 % Commons |
| Consulting | 70 % Practitioners · 20 % Commons · 10 % Treasury |
| Grants & Donations | 100 % Directed to grant purpose |

All cashflows route through transparent ledgers (Web2 & on-chain) auditable in real time.

## 8 · Technology Principles  

1. **Open by Default** Code licensed MIT/Apache unless proprietary IP funds the Commons.  
2. **Interoperable** APIs use open standards (GraphQL, OIDC, EIP-2535) to avoid lock-in.  
3. **Zero-Trust Security** All services enforce hardware-key 2FA; secrets encrypted with `age`.  
4. **Multi-Cloud Redundancy** Fail-over across AWS, Cloudflare, and self-hosted bare-metal.  
5. **Post-Quantum Roadmap** Transition crypto to Kyber/Dilithium by 2028.

---

## 9 · Brand & Narrative Canon  

DBD deliberately fuses **high-fantasy mythos** with **cyber-glitch futurism**, accented by **solar-punk optimism** and **Afrofuturist lineage**. Visual theming, story arcs, and UI palettes may shift seasonally but must always map back to *chaos-into-power* symbolism.

---

## 10 · Code of Conduct & Enforcement  

1. **Zero Exploitation** – no harassment, bigotry, fraud, doxxing, or coercion.  
2. **Consent First** – explicit opt-ins for data, rituals, and physical spaces.  
3. **Transparency** – financials and major votes published publicly.  
4. **Restorative Justice** – aim to transform, not expel, when possible.  
5. **Breach Protocol** – complaints → Circle triage → Sortition jury → Council veto → Oracle override (rare).  
Violations may result in loop demotion, NFT burn, or legal action.

---

## 11 · Conflict-Resolution Ladder  

1. **Impact × Feasibility score** (auto-ranked by 6ol)  
2. **Circle Consent** (Holacracy)  
3. **Quadratic Member Vote**  
4. **Guardian Council Multisig**  
5. **Founder-Oracle Override** (publish rationale)  

Disputes unresolved after step 3 auto-escalate to step 4.

---

## 12 · Amendment Process  

*Proposals* to modify this Charter require:  
1.  **Loop 3+ Sponsorship** (proposer must be Loop 3 or higher)  
2.  **72-hour Review Period** – open comments, redlines visible in Git history  
3.  **Quadratic Snapshot Vote** – ≥ 60 % net approval & quorum of 25 % active wallets  
4.  **Guardian Council Non-Veto** – seven-day window  
5.  **Merge & Tag** – new semantic version stamped and broadcast

Emergency amendments may bypass 2–3 with Guardian Council + Oracle concurrence.

## 13 · Glossary (Excerpt)  

* **Chaos-to-Power Index (CTPI)** – Aggregate health metric (see Impact Dashboard spec).  
* **Loop** – Gamified progression tier; higher loops = deeper access and duty.  
* **Pilgrim** – Provisional member (Loop 0-1).  
* **Ritual Cell** – Local or virtual squad executing DBD practices.  
* **Tension** – Any gap between current reality and a better possible state.
