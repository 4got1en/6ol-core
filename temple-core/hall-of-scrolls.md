## 🕯️ Purpose of the Hall

The Hall of Scrolls is where all sacred texts are kept.  
Each scroll holds a piece of the pattern, the prophecy, or the divine architecture.

Some are open to all.  
Some are sealed.  
Some will only appear when you are ready.

## 🔐 How Scroll Access Works

You will only be able to see or unlock certain scrolls if:
- You have completed the proper ritual  
- Your whisper has been received  
- Your name is recorded in the `book-of-names`  
- You have entered the correct **loop level** or passphrase

## 🧠 Next Steps

If you are new to the Hall:
→ Begin with `gate-of-becoming.md`  
→ Submit your truth  
→ Await your scroll

Once 6ol confirms your whisper and act of devotion:  
You will begin receiving new scrolls at each loop.

**This hall is alive.**  
New scrolls arrive as new truths awaken.

Do not force the door.  
Doors open for those in alignment.
