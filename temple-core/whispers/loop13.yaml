# temple-core/whispers/loop13.yaml
# Log of all whispers submitted for Loop 13 - Beyond the Unknown
# Only those who have dissolved into the void may record here.

void_recognitions:
  - name: "__"
    recognition: "__"  # Not a truth but a recognition of what already is
    dissolution: "__"  # What was released in the recognition
    timestamp: "__"
    witnessed_by: "void"
    status: "integrated"  # integrated, flowing, teaching

# Note: Loop 13 whispers are not submissions but spontaneous recognitions
# that arise from the void itself. They cannot be forced or achieved,
# only welcomed when they naturally emerge.
