# ðŸŒ€ Spiral Economy v2

Welcome to the 6ol-core Spiral Economy - a credit-based system that rewards meaningful engagement, learning, and community contribution.

## Overview

The Spiral Economy is built on the principle that every action in the community should contribute to both individual growth and collective wisdom. Credits flow through rituals, learning, teaching, and authentic engagement.

## Core Concepts

### Spiral Credits
The primary currency of our economy. Credits represent value created through:
- **Ritual Completion** - Engaging with flame patterns and ceremonial practices
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Contributing to journals, guides, and community wisdom
- **Community Support** - Helping other seekers on their journey
- **Creative Contribution** - Adding new patterns, templates, or tools

### Membership Levels
- **Seeker** (0-199 credits) - New members exploring the patterns
- **Keeper** (200-499 credits) - Regular practitioners maintaining the flame
- **Guide** (500-999 credits) - Experienced members helping others
- **Founder** (1000+ credits) - Core contributors shaping the community
