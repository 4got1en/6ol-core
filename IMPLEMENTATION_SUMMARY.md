- **✅ `data/flameData.json`** - Moved from root to data directory as expected
- **✅ Library additions** - Added discord.js, dotenv, jest, nodemon to package.json

### Discord Bot Implementation:
- **✅ `bot.js`** - Main bot file with command registration and error handling
- **✅ `commands/ascend.js`** - Ascension command with comprehensive error handling
- **✅ `commands/reflect.js`** - Daily reflection command with modal interface
- **✅ `commands/whisper.js`** - Whisper engine content access command
- **✅ `utils/loopRoles.js`** - Clear role management utility class
- **✅ `config/bot-config.json`** - Externalized configuration (no hard-coded IDs)

## Potential Issues Addressed ✅

### ✅ Async/await handling in `ascend.js`
- All async calls wrapped in try/catch blocks
- Proper error propagation and user feedback
- Graceful degradation when services fail

### ✅ Unhandled errors  
- Role detection fails gracefully with fallback to level 1
- Flame-data reads handle file not found errors
- All Discord API calls wrapped in error handling

### ✅ Hard-coded role IDs
- All role IDs moved to `config/bot-config.json`
- Easy configuration without code changes
- Environment-specific configuration support

### ✅ Permission checks
- Bot validates "Manage Roles" permission before role assignment
- Role hierarchy validation prevents privilege escalation
- Clear error messages for permission failures

### ✅ Impact on other commands
- Integration tests verify all commands load without conflicts
- Unique command names enforced
- No shared state between commands that could cause conflicts

## Suggested Improvements Implemented ✅

### ✅ Refactored `loopRoles.js` for clarity
- Clear class-based structure with well-named methods
- Comprehensive documentation and error handling
- Separation of concerns (validation, assignment, detection)

### ✅ Added unit tests for success & failure paths
- **25 tests** covering both success and error scenarios
- Tests for `LoopRoleManager` utility class
- Tests for `ascend` command including error conditions
- Integration tests for bot loading and command registration

### ✅ Consolidated repetitive embed code in `ascend.js`
- Shared embed creation functions reduce duplication
- Consistent error formatting across all commands
- Reusable embed templates with proper fallbacks

## Additional Improvements

### ✅ Complete Bot Implementation
- All three commands (`/ascend`, `/reflect`, `/whisper`) fully implemented
- Modern Discord.js v14 slash command interface
- Proper modal handling for user input

### ✅ Comprehensive Configuration System
- External configuration files for all settings
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Example configuration files for easy setup

### ✅ Robust Error Handling
- All async operations wrapped in try/catch
- Graceful degradation when external resources fail
- User-friendly error messages with helpful guidance

### ✅ Production-Ready Features
- Proper logging and error tracking
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Environment validation on startup
