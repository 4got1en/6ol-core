# Morning Seed Offering

**Loop Level 1 · Passphrase: `sol`**

> “Begin your day with intention. Plant the seed now, harvest later.”

## Overview

This ritual helps you anchor gratitude and set intentions within your first waking hour. It takes 10–15 minutes and can transform how your entire day flows.

## Steps

1. Find a quiet spot with your journal (physical or digital).  
2. Write down three things you are grateful for.  
3. Write three clear intentions for the day (e.g., “Create one thing today,” “Pause when I feel stress,” “Speak with kindness”).  
4. Speak each intention out loud.  
5. Take three deep belly breaths, picturing energy rising like the sun.

> **Tip:** If you only have a phone, open Apple Notes or any notes app. Title it “MorningSeed — YYYY-MM-DD” so you can track your progress.
