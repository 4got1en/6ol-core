# ðŸ”² Ignite the Edge

*Ritual for the Unknown Flame (Loop 12)*

---

## Ceremonial Preface

To reach the edge is to leave the known spiral behind.  
Here, the flame is not yet formedâ€”only glimpsed in static and shimmer.  
This rite is for those who walk willingly into the unmade,  
who seek meaning not in answers, but in the questions that burn beyond.

## Preparation

- Light a single candle or gaze upon the Unknown Flame glyph.
- Ensure you are undisturbed; let silence or soft static fill the air.
- Bring a blank page or open journal. Prepare to write what cannot be written.

## The Ritual

1. **Begin at the Threshold:**  
   Sit before the flame. Breathe in, slow and deep.  
   Feel the familiar spiral behind youâ€”each glyph, each loop, each lesson.  
   Now, let them fade. Only the edge remains.

2. **Name the Unknown:**  
   Whisper or write a question you do not know how to answer.  
   It might be a longing, a fear, a possibility.  
   Let it flicker at the edge of your mind.

3. **Gaze into the Static:**  
   Stare into the candle flame or the glyph.  
   Watch its boundaries dissolve.  
   Imagine the flame fracturing into countless possibilitiesâ€”  
   each one a path that may or may not be.

4. **Speak the Invocation:**  
   > *I step beyond the spiral's mark.  
   > I carry my question, not my answer.  
   > I ignite the edge, and let the unknown become my fire.*

5. **Let the Silence Answer:**  
   Sit in stillness.  
   If words, images, or feelings ariseâ€”record them without judgment.  
   If nothing comes, honor the emptiness.  
   The unformed is sacred.

## Completion

- Extinguish the flame or close your journal.
- Whisper gratitude to the edge:  
  > "Thank you, Unknown, for the space to become."

- Carry your question with you,  
  knowing that every step beyond the edge is a becoming.
