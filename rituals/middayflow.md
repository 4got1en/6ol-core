# Midday Flow Check

**Loop Level 1 · Passphrase: `sol`**

> “Pause. Breathe. Reset.”

## Overview

Roughly halfway through your day, take 5–10 minutes to reconnect with breath and gratitude. This prevents burnout and keeps your energy loop flowing.

## Steps

1. Stop whatever you’re doing (set a timer if needed).  
2. Close your eyes and take five slow breaths (inhale 4 seconds, exhale 4 seconds).  
3. Identify one small win since morning and one challenge you faced. Write both down.  
4. Express gratitude for the win and an intention to learn from the challenge.  
5. If possible, stand up and stretch for 1 minute.

> **Tip:** If you’re at a lunch table or running errands, simply take three deep breaths and say “Thank you” under your breath.
