# Evening Harvest

**Loop Level 1 · Passphrase: `sol`**

> “Reflect on what you sowed today. Gather insights for tomorrow.”

## Overview

In the final hour before sleep, record your daily lessons, wins, and growth edges. This closes the loop and sets you up for a fresh start tomorrow.

## Steps

1. Open your journal (physical or digital).  
2. Write down three things that went well today.  
3. Write down one lesson you learned (no matter how small).  
4. If you used either Morning Seed or Midday Flow Check, note how it affected your day.  
5. Read over what you wrote. Close with: “I am grateful for today and ready for tomorrow.”

> **Tip:** If you have a “redlog book,” write this entry there as part of your black-journal ritual.
