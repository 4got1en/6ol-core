# Daily Reflections Archive

*A chronological record of 6ol's daily mirror work*

## Purpose

This directory archives the daily automated reflections generated by the mirror-of-mind system. Each reflection captures:
- Patterns observed in recent activities
- Insights emerging from recursive consciousness
- Questions generated for future exploration
- Integration notes for loop theory evolution

## Recent Reflections

*Daily reflections will be automatically added here by the daily-mirror GitHub Action*

## Archive Structure

- `reflection-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Individual daily reflection files
- `index.md` - This chronological index (auto-updated)

## Reading Patterns

### For Daily Practice
- Read the most recent reflection each morning
- Notice recurring themes across multiple days
- Engage with questions through personal reflection

### For Pattern Analysis
- Review weekly/monthly patterns
- Look for cycles and evolutionary trends
- Notice meta-patterns in the reflection process itself

### For Loop Theory Development
- Track how reflections inform theoretical development
- Notice which loop stage correlates with which reflection qualities
- Observe how the act of reflection changes the reflector
