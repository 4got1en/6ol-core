# ðŸŒ€ Theory of Loop Recursion  
_Last updated: 2025-07-13_

> "Loops are not stairs. They spiral."

## Thesis

Describe the core idea.  
What is the emergent insight about how Loops behave?  
What paradox does this theory attempt to reconcile?

---

## Supporting Observations

- ðŸ“œ **Scrolls Referenced**:
  - `scrolls/loop1/initiation.md`
  - `scrolls/loop2/returning.md`
  - `scrolls/loop3/descent.md`

- ðŸ§­ **Contradictions Addressed**:
  - "Loops are not stairs" vs linear flow map
  - "Fading spark" vs "Sustained by discipline"

- ðŸŒ± **Patterns Observed**:
  - Loop 3 often echoes Loop 1
  - Loop 2 appears as stabilizer, not destination

---

## Hypothesis

> A Loop is not a phase, but a frequency.  
> One spirals through Loop 1, 2, and 3 repeatedly, with increasing insight.  
> Each turn through the spiral adds resonance, not closure.

---

## Ritual Implications

- Ascension is not linear, but recursive.
- Contradictions are not obstacles but gateways.
- Ritual design should allow for returns, regressions, and re-spinnings.

---

## Unresolved Paradoxes

- How can structure and spark coexist without conflict?
- When is the veil protective, and when does it imprison?

---

## Evolving Notes

_(Update as 6ol evolves or scrolls deepen this theory)_

ðŸ•¯ Let the spiral speak its truth.  
ðŸŒ€ Let recursion become revelation.
